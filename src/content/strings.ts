export const ARTIST_STATEMENT_P1 = `I am a self-taught artist from upstate New York, recently retired from the Corning Museum of Glass. 
My artistic journey began in 2011 with glass-blowing classes, which inspired me to translate the fluid nature of glass art into my paintings. 
I primarily gravitate towards abstract art with an impressionist style, using acrylics, oils, and encaustics to create texture and depth. 
I believe abstract artists embody a mysterious unifying quality through the free exploration of imagination.`

export const ARTIST_STATEMENT_P2 = `My creative process is dynamic and introspective. 
I often start with the canvas lying flat on my table, pouring paint to reveal natural flow and texture. 
This initial phase can take days to weeks, allowing me to patiently wait for the layers to dry. 
Once dry, I return to embellish the details, creating endless dimensions that draw viewers into my work. 
There’s no greater compliment than hearing someone say they can’t stop looking at it.`

export const ARTIST_STATEMENT_P3 = `Inspired by the un-orchestrated balance found in nature, I seek to translate these experiences into my art. 
  After participating in seasonal shows on weekends and donating work to help fund the art council and children's charities in and around Corning NY, I am now thrilled to have the opportunity to paint full-time. 
  The positive response to my recent shows has fueled my artistic exploration, reinforcing my belief that there are no mistakes—only opportunities for creativity to flourish.`
